# These are non-standard, but frequently occurring relator codes in our data
# They are separated from the main relator_categories.yaml file because eventually
#  we expect that file to be generated based on standard code lists and we do not
#  want to lose the categorizations for non-standard terms when that gets updated.
#  Also, separating these allows us to warn about non-standard values (which can be
#  passed on for catalog cleanup if desired), but still assign the names to  a category.
